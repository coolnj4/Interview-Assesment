Problem Statement

1.Read the file 'data.xyz' attached with the document which has xyz data with respect to different timestamps. Segment at 18:51:35.232 and 19:02:14.621 and give the output as three segments.
2.Read the image 'oculus.jpg' and try different algorithms for enhancing and denoising and compare the results.
3.Create a simple neural network which can predict positive and negative integer using tensorflow, pytorch or any library.
